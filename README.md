I am a Software Engineer at Plymouth Rock Assurance, where I use Java, Spring, and AWS to implement system multi-request processing and business logic. I graduated from University at Buffalo with a Bachelor of Arts in Computational and Applied Mathematics, which gives me a solid foundation for solving complex problems and applying data analysis techniques. In my previous roles, I have developed web applications, data synchronization features, and database connectivity solutions using various technologies such as Spring boot, Maven, PHP, AWS Lambda, DevOps, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JDBC, and etc. I have also collaborated with contractors, team members, and clients to ensure high-quality deliverables and positive outcomes.
