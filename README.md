### Hi there 👋

You have somehow managed to find my page. This is 金琛然 (jīn chēn rán). I am seeking Full-Time Software Engineer Job (backend/iOS) right now. Experienced in Java, Python, PHP, and Swift. Familiar with Go and C. After 3 years at Valdosta State University, I transferred to Univ. at Buffalo, changed my major to computing and applied mathematics. I stumbled upon a good idea to put together what I easily forget, and I it is hidden now.
