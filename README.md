You have somehow managed to find my page. This is Chenran Jin. I am seeking Full-Time Software Engineer Job (backend/iOS) right now. Experienced in Java, Python, PHP, and Swift. Familiar with Go and C. After 3 years at Valdosta State University, I transferred to Univ. at Buffalo, changed my major to computing and applied mathematics. I stumbled upon a good idea to put together what I easily forget, and it is hidden now.
